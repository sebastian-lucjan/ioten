# Example app with styled-components

This example features how you use a different styling solution than [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) that also supports universal styles. That means we can serve the required styles for the first render within the HTML and then load the rest in the client. In this case we are using [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

For this purpose we are extending the `<Document />` and injecting the server side rendered styles into the `<head>`, and also adding the `babel-plugin-styled-components` (which is required for server side rendering). Additionally we set up a global [theme](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming) for styled-components using NextJS custom [`<App>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app) component.

### Notes

When wrapping a [Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) from `next/link` within a styled-component, the [as](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#as-polymorphic-prop) prop provided by `styled` will collide with the Link's `as` prop and cause styled-components to throw an `Invalid tag` error. To avoid this, you can either use the recommended [forwardedAs](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#forwardedas-prop) prop from styled-components or use a different named prop to pass to a `styled` Link.
